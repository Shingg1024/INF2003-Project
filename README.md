# INF2003-Project

## Introduction:
With the easing of COVID-19 travel restrictions in Japan, Kyoto has regained its position as a top tourist destination. However, travelers currently face the challenge of independently researching and finding recommended restaurants near their accommodations. There is a noticeable absence of applications that seamlessly combine hotel bookings and restaurant recommendations in Kyoto.

To address this issue, we propose the creation of a comprehensive web application dedicated to booking and reviewing hotels and restaurants in Kyoto. Our goal is to offer travelers an up-to-date one-stop solution for all their lodging and dining needs, offering maximum convenience.

## Objectives:
Our web application project aims to fulfill the pressing need for a convenient travel planning tool in Kyoto. We prioritize the convenience of travelers by streamlining the process of arranging accommodations and dining experiences.

Our primary goal is to save tourists time, as we understand that researching and reserving hotels and restaurants may be time-consuming and overwhelming. We hope to simplify trip planning by combining various services into a single user-friendly website, allowing passengers to plan their vacations more effectively and spend more time discovering and relaxing.

Beyond convenience, our vision is to elevate the overall travel experience in Kyoto. We go beyond mere reservations and offer valuable insights and recommendations from locals and experienced travelers. Our platform empowers users to make informed choices, uncover hidden gems, and fully immerse themselves in Kyoto's rich culture and cuisine.
